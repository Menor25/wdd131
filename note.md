### Colors: Use a color scheme that is visually appealing and conveys the desired mood or message. Limit the color palette to five hues or less. Test color contrast to ensure readability for all users.
### Clarity: Keep the design clean and uncluttered. Use ample whitespace to guide the user's focus and avoid overwhelming them with too much information at once. Do not be wordy, use visuals to help communicate your message.
### Consistency: Maintain a consistent visual language throughout the design. This includes using consistent typography, color schemes, and layout patterns across different pages or sections of your design.
### Visual Hierarchy: Establish a clear hierarchy of information to help users understand the relative importance of different elements on the page. Use techniques like size, color, and typography to emphasize important content.
### Accessibility: Ensure that your design is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. This may involve considerations such as providing alternative text for images, using sufficient color contrast, and implementing keyboard navigation. You can test your design for accessibility using tools like a WAVE, Axe, or Lighthouse.
### Feedback: Provide clear feedback to users when they interact with elements on the page. This could include visual cues such as button states or animations to indicate that an action has been successfully completed.
### User-Centric Design: Design with the needs and preferences of your target audience in mind. Conduct user research to understand their goals, behaviors, and pain points, and tailor your design accordingly.
### Visual Appeal: Use visually appealing elements such as high-quality images, engaging animations, and attractive typography to capture the user's attention and create a memorable experience. 
### Serving desktop-sized images to mobile devices can use 2-4x more data than needed. Instead of a "one-size-fits-all" approach to images, serve different image sizes to different devices. How many image versions should you create? There is no single 'correct' answer to this question. However, it's common to serve 3-5 different sizes of an image. Serving more image sizes is better for performance, but will take up more space on your servers and require writing a tiny bit more HTML.
### A core user experience (UX) principle is that users expect to scroll web pages vertically without needing to scroll horizontally to view content. Additionally, users should not have to zoom in or out to see page content clearly.
